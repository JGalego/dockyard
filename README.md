# Dockyard - MCP Server Container Builder

> **A centralized repository for packaging Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers into containers**

Dockyard automatically builds and publishes container images for MCP servers that aren't already containerized. It uses [ToolHive](https://docs.stacklok.com/toolhive) to build containers from protocol schemes and provides a simple YAML-based configuration system.

## üöÄ Quick Start

Want to add your MCP server? Just create a YAML file in the appropriate protocol directory and submit a PR! Our automated CI/CD pipeline will build and publish the container image automatically.

## üì¶ Supported Protocols

- **`npx://`** - Node.js packages from npm registry
- **`uvx://`** - Python packages using uv package manager
- **`go://`** - Go packages and modules

## üèóÔ∏è Available MCP Servers

| Server | Protocol | Container Image | Description |
|--------|----------|-----------------|-------------|
| [Context7](https://github.com/upstash/context7-mcp) | npx | `ghcr.io/stacklok/dockyard/npx/context7:1.0.14` | Upstash vector search and context management |
| [AWS Documentation](https://github.com/awslabs/mcp) | uvx | `ghcr.io/stacklok/dockyard/uvx/aws-documentation-mcp-server:1.1.2` | AWS Labs documentation server |

## ü§ù Contributing Your Own MCP Server

Adding your MCP server to Dockyard is simple! Follow these steps:

### Step 1: Choose the Right Protocol Directory

- **`npx/`** - For Node.js packages published to npm
- **`uvx/`** - For Python packages published to PyPI
- **`go/`** - For Go modules and packages

### Step 2: Create Your MCP Server Directory and Configuration

Create a new directory for your MCP server in the appropriate protocol folder, then add a `spec.yaml` file:

```bash
# Create directory structure
mkdir -p {protocol}/{your-server-name}

# Create spec.yaml file
```

The `spec.yaml` file should have this structure:

```yaml
# Comments are encouraged! Describe what your MCP server does
# Package URL: https://...
# Repository: https://...
# Will build as: ghcr.io/stacklok/dockyard/{protocol}/{name}:{version}

metadata:
  name: your-server-name           # Required: Unique server name
  description: "Brief description" # Optional: What does your server do?
  version: "1.0.0"                # Optional: Server version
  protocol: npx                   # Required: npx, uvx, or go

spec:
  package: "your-package-name"    # Required: Package name from registry
  version: "1.0.0"               # Required: Specific version to build

provenance:                       # Optional but recommended
  repository_uri: "https://github.com/user/repo"  # Source repository
  repository_ref: "refs/tags/v1.0.0"              # Git tag/branch/commit
```

### Step 3: Protocol-Specific Examples

#### NPX (Node.js) Example

Directory structure:
```
npx/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ my-node-server/
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ spec.yaml
```

Content of `npx/my-node-server/spec.yaml`:
```yaml
# NPM package: https://www.npmjs.com/package/@your-org/mcp-server
metadata:
  name: my-node-server
  description: "My awesome Node.js MCP server"
  version: "2.1.0"

```

#### Go Example

Directory structure:
```
go/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ my-go-server/
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ spec.yaml
```

Content of `go/my-go-server/spec.yaml`:
```yaml
# Go module: go get github.com/your-org/go-mcp-server
metadata:
  name: my-go-server
  description: "My awesome Go MCP server"
  version: "0.3.1"
  protocol: go

spec:
  package: "github.com/your-org/go-mcp-server"  # Go module path

provenance:
  repository_uri: "https://github.com/your-org/go-mcp-server"
  repository_ref: "refs/tags/v0.3.1"
```

### Step 4: Submit Your Pull Request

1. Fork this repository
2. Create your server directory and `spec.yaml` file in the appropriate protocol directory
3. Submit a pull request with:
   - Clear title: "Add [Your Server Name] MCP server"
   - Description of what your server does
   - Link to the package registry and source repository

**Note**: Your MCP server will be automatically scanned for security vulnerabilities. The PR will only be mergeable if the security scan passes.

### Step 5: Automated Building

Once your PR passes security scanning and is merged:
- ‚úÖ Security scan ensures no vulnerabilities
- ü§ñ GitHub Actions automatically detects your new configuration
- üèóÔ∏è Builds a container image using ToolHive
- üì¶ Publishes to `ghcr.io/stacklok/dockyard/{protocol}/{name}:{version}`
- üîÑ Renovate keeps your package version up-to-date automatically

## üîí Security Scanning

Dockyard automatically scans all MCP servers for security vulnerabilities before building containers using [mcp-scan](https://github.com/invariantlabs-ai/mcp-scan) from Invariant Labs. This ensures that only secure MCP servers are deployed.

### What We Scan For

- **Prompt Injection Risks**: Detects dangerous words or patterns in tool descriptions that could be exploited
- **Toxic Flows**: Identifies combinations of tools that could lead to destructive behaviors
- **Tool Poisoning**: Checks for malicious tool implementations
- **Cross-Origin Escalation**: Detects potential privilege escalation vulnerabilities
- **Rug Pull Attacks**: Identifies suspicious patterns that could indicate malicious intent

### Security Requirements

All MCP servers must pass security scanning before being merged. If vulnerabilities are detected:
- The CI pipeline will fail
- A detailed report will be posted as a PR comment
- The vulnerabilities must be addressed OR explicitly allowed before the PR can be merged

### Allowing Known Issues

Some security warnings may be false positives, especially for containerized deployments where additional sandboxing is provided. You can explicitly allow specific security issues by adding a `security` section to your YAML configuration:

```yaml
security:
  # Security allowlist for known issues that are acceptable in this context
  allowed_issues:
    - code: "W001"
      reason: "Tool description contains imperative instructions for AI agents which are necessary for proper operation"
    - code: "TF002"
      reason: "Destructive toxic flow is mitigated by container sandboxing - code execution is isolated from host system"
```

Each allowed issue must include:
- `code`: The issue code reported by mcp-scan (e.g., W001, TF002, E001)
- `reason`: A clear explanation of why this issue is acceptable in your specific context

### Security Report Example

When vulnerabilities are found, you'll see a detailed report in your PR:

```
## üîí MCP Security Scan Results

### ‚ùå your-mcp-server
- **Status**: Failed
- **Tools scanned**: 3
- **Vulnerabilities found**: 2

**Security issues detected:**
- **[W001]** Tool description contains dangerous words that could be used for prompt injection
- **[TF002]** Destructive toxic flow detected
```

If issues are allowlisted, they won't fail the build:

```
‚ÑπÔ∏è  Allowed security issues found in your-mcp-server:
  - [W001] Tool description contains dangerous words...
    Reason: Tool description contains imperative instructions for AI agents which are necessary for proper operation
‚úÖ All issues are allowlisted - build can proceed (3 tools scanned)
```

## üîê Container Security & Attestations

All container images built by Dockyard are signed and attested using Sigstore for supply chain security. Each image includes:

- **Container Signatures**: Images are signed with Sigstore/Cosign
- **SBOM Attestation**: Software Bill of Materials (SPDX format) for dependency tracking
- **Build Provenance**: Build provenance attestation for build integrity
- **Security Scan Attestation**: MCP security scan results are attested

### Verifying Container Signatures

To verify that an image was built and signed by Dockyard:

```bash
# Install cosign if you haven't already
brew install cosign  # or see https://docs.sigstore.dev/cosign/installation/

# Verify image signature
cosign verify \
  --certificate-identity-regexp "https://github.com/stacklok/dockyard/.github/workflows/build-containers.yml@refs/heads/.*" \
  --certificate-oidc-issuer https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com \
  ghcr.io/stacklok/dockyard/npx/context7:1.0.14
```

### Verifying Attestations

#### Build Provenance & SBOM Attestations (OCI Artifacts)

Docker buildx automatically creates and pushes SBOM (SPDX format) and provenance attestations as OCI artifacts. These are stored alongside the image and can be inspected using Docker buildx:

```bash
# View SBOM attestation for all platforms
docker buildx imagetools inspect \
  ghcr.io/stacklok/dockyard/npx/context7:1.0.14 \
  --format "{{ json .SBOM }}"

# View Provenance attestation for all platforms
docker buildx imagetools inspect \
  ghcr.io/stacklok/dockyard/npx/context7:1.0.14 \
  --format "{{ json .Provenance }}"

# Get the raw SBOM for a specific platform
docker buildx imagetools inspect \
  ghcr.io/stacklok/dockyard/npx/context7:1.0.14 \
  --format '{{ range .SBOM }}{{ if eq .Platform "linux/amd64" }}{{ .Data }}{{ end }}{{ end }}' | base64 -d | jq

# Get the raw Provenance for a specific platform
docker buildx imagetools inspect \
  ghcr.io/stacklok/dockyard/npx/context7:1.0.14 \
  --format '{{ range .Provenance }}{{ if eq .Platform "linux/amd64" }}{{ .Data }}{{ end }}{{ end }}' | base64 -d | jq
```

Note: These attestations are stored as OCI artifacts in the registry, not as Sigstore attestations. They provide supply chain transparency but are verified differently than cosign attestations.

#### Security Scan Attestation (Sigstore)

Our custom security scan attestations are created using cosign and can be verified when they exist:

```bash
# Verify and retrieve security scan attestation (if available)
cosign verify-attestation \
  --type https://github.com/stacklok/dockyard/mcp-security-scan/v1 \
  --certificate-identity-regexp "https://github.com/stacklok/dockyard/.github/workflows/build-containers.yml@refs/heads/.*" \
  --certificate-oidc-issuer https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com \
  ghcr.io/stacklok/dockyard/npx/context7:1.0.14 2>/dev/null | jq '.payload | @base64d | fromjson | .predicate.scanResult'
```

Note: Security scan attestations are only created when the MCP security scan runs and produces results for that specific image build.

### Security Guarantees

When you use a Dockyard container image, you can be confident that:

1. **Source Integrity**: The image was built from the exact source code in this repository
2. **Build Transparency**: Full build provenance is available and verifiable
3. **Security Scanning**: The MCP server was scanned for security vulnerabilities before packaging
4. **Dependency Tracking**: Complete SBOM is available for vulnerability management
5. **Non-repudiation**: Signatures prove the image came from our CI/CD pipeline

## üèóÔ∏è How It Works

1. **Detection**: GitHub Actions detects changes to YAML files
2. **Security Scan**: Runs mcp-scan to check for vulnerabilities
3. **Validation**: Validates YAML structure and required fields
4. **Protocol Scheme**: Constructs protocol scheme (e.g., `npx://@upstash/context7-mcp@1.0.14`)
5. **Container Build**: Uses ToolHive's `BuildFromProtocolSchemeWithName` function (only if security scan passes)
6. **Attestation**: Creates and signs SBOM, provenance, and security scan attestations
7. **Publishing**: Pushes to GitHub Container Registry with automatic tagging
8. **Updates**: Renovate automatically creates PRs for new package versions

## üìã Container Image Naming

All containers follow this naming pattern:
```
ghcr.io/stacklok/dockyard/{protocol}/{name}:{version}
```

Examples:
- `ghcr.io/stacklok/dockyard/npx/context7:1.0.14`
- `ghcr.io/stacklok/dockyard/uvx/aws-documentation-mcp-server:1.1.2`
- `ghcr.io/stacklok/dockyard/go/my-mcp-server:latest`
