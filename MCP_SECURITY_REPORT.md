- **color-convert** (193.5M weekly downloads) - Found in 1 package
- **color-string** (27.48M weekly downloads) - Found in 1 package

## Malware Capabilities

The injected malware in these packages:
1. **Hijacks cryptocurrency transactions** in browsers
2. **Silently replaces wallet addresses** with attacker-controlled ones
3. **Supports multiple cryptocurrencies**: Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, Tron, Litecoin
4. **Hooks into browser APIs**: `fetch`, `XMLHttpRequest`, `window.ethereum`
5. **Uses lookalike addresses** to avoid detection
6. **Operates transparently** - users see correct UI but sign malicious transactions

## üõ°Ô∏è CONTAINER-BASED MITIGATION (Default Protection)

**Important:** Even WITHOUT network isolation, running MCPs in containers provides significant protection:

### What Containers Already Protect Against:

1. **No Browser Access** ‚ùå
   - The malware targets browser APIs (`window.ethereum`, `fetch`, `XMLHttpRequest`)
   - MCP containers have **NO browser environment**
   - The malicious code cannot access cryptocurrency wallets or browser-based transactions

2. **Process Isolation** üîí
   - Each MCP runs in its own container with isolated processes
   - Cannot access host system processes or other containers
   - Cannot modify host system files or steal credentials

3. **Limited Attack Surface** üì¶
   - MCP servers are command-line tools, not web applications
   - No DOM, no window object, no browser crypto APIs
   - The primary attack vector (browser hijacking) is completely ineffective

### What the Malware CAN Still Do in Containers:

‚ö†Ô∏è **Without network isolation, the malware could still:**
- Make unauthorized network requests to attacker servers
- Potentially exfiltrate environment variables or configuration
- Act as a backdoor for remote commands
- Consume resources (CPU/memory) for cryptomining
- Attempt to exploit other vulnerabilities in the container

### Risk Assessment by Attack Vector:

| Attack Vector | Risk in Browser | Risk in Container | With Network Isolation |
|--------------|-----------------|-------------------|----------------------|
| Crypto wallet hijacking | üî¥ CRITICAL | ‚úÖ None (no browser) | ‚úÖ None |
| Transaction redirection | üî¥ CRITICAL | ‚úÖ None (no wallets) | ‚úÖ None |
| Data exfiltration | üî¥ HIGH | üü° MEDIUM | ‚úÖ None |
| C&C communication | üî¥ HIGH | üü° MEDIUM | ‚úÖ Blocked |
| Cryptomining | üü° MEDIUM | üü° MEDIUM | ‚úÖ Blocked |
| Backdoor access | üî¥ HIGH | üü° MEDIUM | ‚úÖ Blocked |

### Summary: You're Already Partially Protected!

‚úÖ **The main attack vector (browser crypto hijacking) is completely neutralized by containers**
‚ö†Ô∏è **Secondary risks (data exfiltration, backdoors) remain without network isolation**
üõ°Ô∏è **Adding network isolation eliminates ALL remaining risks**

##  IMMEDIATE ACTIONS REQUIRED

### 1. **ENABLE NETWORK ISOLATION FOR ALL MCP SERVERS**
   ```bash
   # For each compromised MCP, run with isolation:
   thv run --isolate-network <mcp-server-name>
   ```
   
   This immediately blocks the malware from communicating with attacker infrastructure.

### 2. **Review and Restrict Permissions**
   Check each MCP's default permissions:
   ```bash
   thv registry info <mcp-server-name>
   ```
   
   If the MCP doesn't need network access, use:
   ```bash
   thv run --isolate-network --permission-profile none <mcp-server-name>
   ```

### 3. **Monitor for Package Updates**
   Some packages have fixes available via `npm audit fix --force`:
   - @datastax/astra-db-mcp ‚Üí 1.0.0
   - @brightdata/mcp ‚Üí 1.3.0
   - @21st-dev/magic ‚Üí 0.0.29
   - @jetbrains/mcp-proxy ‚Üí 1.7.0
   - @circleci/mcp-server-circleci ‚Üí 0.11.2
   - @neondatabase/mcp-server-neon ‚Üí 0.5.0
   - @supabase/mcp-server-supabase ‚Üí 0.4.1
   - tavily-mcp ‚Üí 0.1.4

   **Note:** These are downgrades that may break functionality but are safer.

### 3. **Monitor for Patches**
   - Check npm advisories: https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-8mgj-vmr8-frr6
   - Follow package maintainers for security updates
   - The attack was discovered today (Sept 8, 2025), so patches should arrive soon

### 4. **Audit Your Systems**
   - Check if any cryptocurrency transactions were made while these packages were active
   - Review browser history for suspicious activity
   - Verify all wallet addresses in recent transactions

## Technical Details

The attack was executed through:
1. **Phishing email** from `support@npmjs.help` to package maintainer
2. **Compromised npm account** used to publish malicious versions
3. **Obfuscated JavaScript** injected into popular packages
4. **2+ billion weekly downloads** potentially affected

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (Today)
1. **Enable network isolation** for ALL MCP servers using `--isolate-network`
2. **Use restrictive permission profiles** - only allow necessary endpoints
3. **Monitor egress proxy logs** for blocked malicious attempts:
   ```bash
   docker logs <SERVER_NAME>-egress
   ```

### Short-term (This Week)
1. **Create custom permission profiles** for each MCP with minimal required access
2. **Document allowed endpoints** for each MCP server
3. **Set up alerts** on egress proxy logs for suspicious activity

### Long-term Security Strategy
1. **Always use network isolation** as standard practice
2. **Implement automated dependency scanning** with `npm audit` in CI/CD
3. **Use package pinning** and lock files for critical dependencies
4. **Regular security audits** of all MCP servers
5. **Maintain allowlist of trusted npm packages**

## Example: Securing Compromised MCPs

### For Neon MCP Server (56 vulnerabilities):
```bash
# Create restrictive profile allowing only Neon API
cat > neon-safe.json << EOF
{
  "network": {
    "outbound": {
      "insecure_allow_all": false,
      "allow_host": ["api.neon.tech"],
      "allow_port": [443]
    }
  }
}
EOF

# Run with isolation
thv run --isolate-network --permission-profile ./neon-safe.json mcp-server-neon
```

### For CircleCI MCP Server (10 vulnerabilities):
```bash
# Use registry defaults (already restricted to CircleCI domains)
thv run --isolate-network mcp-server-circleci
```

### For Local-Only MCPs:
```bash
# Block all network access for MCPs that work locally
thv run --isolate-network --permission-profile none <local-mcp-server>
```

## Network Isolation Architecture

When you enable `--isolate-network`, ToolHive creates:
- **Egress proxy container** - Filters outgoing traffic
- **DNS container** - Controls domain resolution
- **Internal network** - Isolates MCP from direct external access
- **Ingress proxy** (for SSE/HTTP transports only)

All traffic flows through these controlled points, ensuring the malware cannot bypass restrictions.
