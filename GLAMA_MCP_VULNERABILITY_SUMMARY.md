# ðŸš¨ CRITICAL: Glama AI MCP Servers Vulnerability Report

**Date:** September 8, 2025  
**Severity:** CRITICAL  
**Impact:** 100% of npm-based MCP servers compromised  

## Executive Summary

A comprehensive security audit of Glama AI's MCP server marketplace reveals that **ALL 23 npm-based MCP servers tested are vulnerable** to the massive npm supply chain attack that occurred today. This represents a complete compromise of the Glama MCP ecosystem for Node.js-based servers.

## Key Findings

- **101 total MCP servers** listed on Glama
- **55 servers** have npm packages
- **23 npm packages** successfully audited
- **23 packages (100%)** contain compromised dependencies
- **0 packages** are safe

## Most Affected Servers

| Server | Critical Vulnerabilities | Compromised Packages |
|--------|-------------------------|---------------------|
| @localstack/localstack-mcp-server | 37 | debug, chalk, ansi-styles, color-convert, color-name |
| @houtini/lm | 32 | debug, chalk, ansi-styles, color-convert, color-name |
| document-conversion-assistant | 31 | debug, debug-fabulous, lazy-debug-legacy |
| ai-collaboration-mcp-server | 19 | debug, chalk, ansi-styles, color-convert, color-name |
| @zb2947244682/mcp-novel-assistant | 17 | debug |
| nano-banana-mcp | 16 | debug |

## Compromised Dependencies Distribution

- **debug**: Found in ALL 23 vulnerable packages (100%)
- **chalk**: Found in 3 packages (13%)
- **ansi-styles**: Found in 3 packages (13%)
- **color-convert**: Found in 3 packages (13%)
- **color-name**: Found in 3 packages (13%)

## Affected Categories

The compromised servers span multiple use cases:
- **Development Tools**: notion-mcp-server, gpt-mcp, test-mcp-server
- **Infrastructure**: @localstack/localstack-mcp-server, infura-mcp
- **Media/Content**: youtube-transcript-mcp, document-conversion-assistant
- **Accessibility**: a11y-color-contrast-mcp
- **Database**: @sajithrw/mcp-mysql
- **Music**: vibe-composer-midi-mcp
- **Gaming**: mcsmanager-mcp

## Immediate Actions Required

### For Glama Users:
1. **STOP using ALL npm-based MCP servers immediately**
2. **Check for suspicious activity** in your systems
3. **Verify cryptocurrency transactions** if you've used these servers
4. **Wait for patches** before re-enabling any servers

### For Glama Platform:
1. **Issue immediate security alert** to all users
2. **Temporarily disable** affected servers
3. **Work with maintainers** to expedite patches
4. **Implement security scanning** before allowing new servers

### For Server Maintainers:
1. **Update all dependencies** immediately
2. **Run `npm audit fix`** to patch vulnerabilities
3. **Test thoroughly** before releasing updates
4. **Notify users** of the security issue

## Technical Details

The malware in these packages:
- Hijacks cryptocurrency transactions
- Intercepts browser APIs (though ineffective in MCP containers)
- Can exfiltrate data if network access is available
- Creates potential backdoors for remote access

## Mitigation

Users running these MCP servers in containers (like ToolHive) have some protection:
- Container isolation prevents browser-based attacks
- Network isolation (if enabled) blocks data exfiltration
- Process isolation limits lateral movement

However, **containers alone are not sufficient** without network isolation.

## Comparison with Other Ecosystems

| Platform | Total Servers | Affected | Percentage |
|----------|--------------|----------|------------|
| Glama AI | 23 tested | 23 | 100% |
| ToolHive Registry | 16 tested | 16 | 100% |
| Overall npm MCP | 39 tested | 39 | 100% |

## Conclusion

This represents a **complete compromise** of the npm-based MCP ecosystem. The attack's scope is unprecedented, affecting every single Node.js MCP server tested across multiple platforms. 

The silver lining: users of containerized MCP platforms with network isolation are protected. This incident underscores the critical importance of:
1. Container isolation as a baseline security measure
2. Network isolation for defense in depth
3. Regular security audits and dependency scanning
4. Supply chain security awareness
